# APIs To Audit

Every public plugin API member ships with an `experimental_` prefix and an
entry here (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), "Plugin API"). Dropping the prefix
is the deliberate stabilization step: audit the entry, rename project-wide,
and delete the entry in the same change.

## `PluginContentScriptContext.experimental_setThreadRowStatus`

Lets a plugin-lifetime content script set or clear one of its own status
indicators on an explicit thread row. The status survives route changes and is
cleared automatically when that frontend generation deactivates.

Before stabilization, audit:

- whether explicit thread targeting belongs on content-script context or a
  dedicated app-level controller;
- multiple simultaneous runs owned by one plugin on one thread;
- arbitration across plugins, frontend generations, and native thread
  statuses;
- persistence expectations across full app reloads and multiple windows;
- validation, accessibility labels, reduced motion, and cleanup on plugin
  reload/disable/removal.

## `experimental_NewThreadComposer` (`@bb/plugin-sdk/app`)

**What it does.** The host-owned new-thread compose surface, the create-side
counterpart to `ThreadChat`. It renders bb's full control set — prompt editor
with @-mentions and expand, `+` attachments, provider/model/reasoning picker,
voice, submit, and the row beneath with project, environment, "Branch from:",
and permission mode — and calls `onSubmit` with a `NewThreadRequest`
carrying every resolved selection.

The composer deliberately does **not** create the thread. The plugin does,
through `bb.sdk.threads.spawn`, which auto-fills `origin: "plugin"` and
`originPluginId`. If the component created the thread it would go through the
host's `useCreateThread` and the thread would look host-originated. So the
rule is: the composer owns user selections; the plugin owns filing
(`sectionId`, `parentThreadId`, `title`, `visibility`) and attribution.

Implementation: `apps/app/src/components/plugin/PluginNewThreadComposer.tsx`,
bound in `apps/app/src/lib/plugin-sdk-app-impl.tsx`.

**Audit before stabilizing.**

1. **Duplicated config assembly vs. `RootComposeView`.** The adapter builds
   `environmentConfig`, `branchConfig`, `worktreeConfig`, `permissionConfig`,
   `executionConfig`, `attachmentsConfig`, `typeaheadConfig`, `historyConfig`,
   and `projectOptions` for `NewThreadPromptBox` a second time — the first
   copy is the `useMemo` block in `apps/app/src/views/RootComposeView.tsx`.
   This was chosen over refactoring that ~3700-line view (additive, zero
   regression risk to the primary compose surface), mirroring how
   `PluginThreadChat` adapts `EmbeddedThreadChat`. Only the pure resolvers are
   shared (`apps/app/src/views/root-compose-environment-selection.ts`). Check
   whether the two copies have drifted, and whether the shared surface should
   grow to cover the config assembly itself before this is stable.

2. **`NewThreadRequest` vs. what `threads.spawn` accepts.** The type mirrors
   the subset of `CreateThreadRequest` a composer can resolve. Confirm every
   field still round-trips through `bb.sdk.threads.spawn` unchanged, that
   `executionInputSources` still means the same thing to the server, and that
   no newly required create-thread field is silently missing. Note the
   composer runs `useThreadCreationOptions` with `scope: "component-local"`,
   which never reports a `providerId` provenance source even though the
   composer always sends an explicit `providerId`; decide whether that is
   correct before freezing the shape.

3. **Page-level behavior the adapter skips.** Fork seeds,
   quick-create-project, the guided machine-setup dialog, welcome/empty
   states, and codex-version submit blocking are all deliberately absent.
   Confirm none of them has become load-bearing for correctness (rather than
   convenience) on a plugin surface — codex-version blocking in particular
   means a plugin can submit to a machine whose CLI the primary surface would
   have refused.

4. **Draft and selection scoping.** Drafts persist under a
   `plugin-new-thread` scope keyed by `draftKey ?? pluginId`, and execution
   selections are component-local so a plugin panel never rewrites the user's
   persisted root-composer defaults. Confirm that is still the behavior
   plugin authors expect, and that `draftKey` is the right knob (versus, say,
   a per-instance ephemeral draft).

5. **No plugin composer host binding.** The instance passes no
   `pluginComposerHost`, so plugin composer customizations, banners, and
   `useComposer()` writes do not reach it. Decide whether composers rendered
   by a plugin should participate in that surface before stabilizing.

6. **Seeding props and the round-trip guarantee.** The `default*` props
   (`defaultProviderId`, `defaultModel`, `defaultReasoningLevel`,
   `defaultServiceTier`, `defaultPermissionMode`, `defaultEnvironment`) seed
   the composer from a stored `NewThreadRequest` so a plugin can re-open a
   saved configuration without silently resetting it to project defaults.
   They are seeds (uncontrolled), take precedence over project defaults, and
   re-seed on any value change — including user-touched selections — via the
   creation-options resetKey. `defaultEnvironment` maps args back to picker
   selections in
   `apps/app/src/components/plugin/new-thread-environment-seed.ts`; its
   unrepresentable variants (`project-default`, `personal` without a
   `hostId`, an `unmanaged` `path`) are documented on the prop. Before
   stabilizing, confirm the mapping still inverts
   `resolveRootComposeThreadEnvironment` (the round-trip tests in
   `new-thread-environment-seed.test.ts` and
   `PluginNewThreadComposer.test.tsx` guard this) and re-decide whether the
   re-seed-on-change rule should instead be an explicit reset nonce.
