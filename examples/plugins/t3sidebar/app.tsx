// bb-plugin-t3sidebar — an inbox-style replacement for bb's sidebar thread
// list, and the reference example for `app.slots.experimental_threadList`.
//
// The idea it is built around: the list NEVER re-orders itself. Threads sort
// by creation time, newest first, and hold that place. Status is carried by
// each card, not by position, so the sidebar only moves when you act.

  // chip is its only route back to the parent.
