# Changelog

## 0.0.29

This release expands agent and model support, introduces a redesigned Settings experience, and includes workflow improvements and reliability fixes across bb.

### More agents, models, and skills

- Added support for Grok Build and Hermes Agent.
- Codex now supports 5.6-Sol, Terra, and Luna.
- Skills and `/` autocomplete now work across Pi and ACP providers, including OpenCode, omp, Grok, Hermes, Cursor, and custom ACP agents.
- Side chats can now use a different model, reasoning level, or service tier while remaining safely read-only.

### Redesigned Settings

- Settings now uses dedicated pages with sidebar navigation.
- Choose which microphone bb uses for voice input.
- Manually check for updates from Settings → Updates.
- On macOS, enable Caffeinate to keep the machine awake while bb is running.
- Discord and GitHub links now live under Settings → Community.

### Workflow improvements

- Right-click local file links to open them in a specific editor, choose a preview, or copy the file name or path.
- Queued messages now render mention pills correctly.
- `bb thread archive` now also archives child threads and side chats.
- `bb thread wait` now waits up to 20 minutes by default, better matching real agent workloads.
- Agent shells more reliably use the correct workspace-managed `bb` CLI.

### Fixes and polish

- Fixed the app becoming unresponsive after creating, renaming, or removing a folder from a sidebar menu.
- Fixed manually marked unread threads remaining unread after reopening.
- Fixed sidebar alignment in macOS fullscreen mode.
- Fixed clipped focus rings in the composer toolbar.
- Simplified thread-row cursors and removed the terminal-count badge from the right-panel toggle.
- Renamed the sidebar feedback action to “Report a bug.”

### Experiments

New experiment to let you connect to bb from other computers.
