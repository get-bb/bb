# bb CLI

Use `bb` when controlling bb itself: inspect current context, coordinate threads,
message agents, or inspect projects, providers, and environments.

## Start With Context

- Use `bb status` to identify the current project, thread, and environment.
- Prefer `--json` when command output will drive follow-up work.
- Run `bb guide` for the system overview and `bb guide <chapter>` for full
  command reference.

## Spawning Threads

- Use `bb thread spawn --prompt "..."` to create another thread.
- Spawn creates a root thread unless you pass `--parent-thread`.
- Spawned child threads inherit permission from explicit flags, then the
  parent thread's last execution, then project defaults.
- Use `--parent-self` inside a thread to parent the new thread to the current
  thread.
- Use `--parent-thread <thread-id>` to choose another specific parent.
- If provider or model choice matters, inspect options with `bb provider list`
  and `bb provider models <provider-id>`.

Give spawned threads clear prompts: objective, constraints, expected deliverable,
validation to perform, and what to report back. Ask for outcome, changed files
or artifacts, validation performed, and blockers.

## Coordinating Work

- Use one clear owner per task.
- Spawn independent tasks separately when parallel work is useful.
- Let threads work after spawning. Do not poll with shell sleeps, repeated log
  reads, or repeated status reads.
- Use `bb thread wait <thread-id>` when you explicitly need to block until a
  thread finishes. It defaults to waiting for `idle`; pass `--status` or
  `--event` for a different target.
- Use `bb thread tell <thread-id> "..."` when requirements change, a blocker
  needs clarification, or follow-up work is needed.

## Inspecting Results

- Use `bb thread show <thread-id>` for status, parent, environment, and result.
- Use `bb thread show <thread-id> --git-diff` to review file changes.
- Use `bb thread log <thread-id>` to inspect the conversation.
- Use `bb thread output <thread-id>` to read the latest final output. Inside a
  thread, omitting `<thread-id>` reads `BB_THREAD_ID`.

For review or fix pipelines, get the environment ID from
`bb thread show <thread-id> --json`, then spawn the follow-up with
`--environment <environment-id>` so it sees the same files.

## Failures And Interruptions

- For failed threads, inspect `bb thread show <id> --json` and
  `bb thread log <id>` before deciding whether to retry, clarify, or update the
  user.
- For interrupted or stopped threads, inspect first. If the user stopped the
  thread, treat that as intentional unless they ask you to continue.
- Use `bb thread stop <id>` when a thread is stuck or no longer needed.
